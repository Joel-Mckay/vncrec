VNC Source Distribution for Unix platforms
==========================================

VNC is Copyright Olivetti & Oracle Research Laboratory.  This software is
distributed under the GNU General Public Licence as published by the Free
Software Foundation.  See the file LICENCE.TXT for the conditions under
which this software is made available.  VNC also contains code from other
sources.  See the Acknowledgements section below, and the individual files
for details of the conditions under which they are made available.


There are four programs here:

	vncviewer - this is the VNC viewer, or client, program for X.

	vncserver - this is a wrapper script which makes starting an X VNC
		    server (i.e. desktop) more convenient.  It is written in
		    Perl, so to use the script you need that.

	vncpasswd - this program allows you to change the password used to
		    access your X VNC desktops.  The vncserver script uses
		    this program when you first start a VNC server.

	Xvnc - this is the X VNC server - it is both an X server and a VNC
	       server.  You normally use the vncserver script to start Xvnc.


First you must have a reasonably recent version of X installed (this includes
/usr/openwin on Solaris machines).  To build everything, do:

	% xmkmf
	% make world

This should build first the vncauth library which is used by each of the
programs, then vncviewer, vncpasswd and finally Xvnc.  Xvnc differs from the
other programs in that it uses its own imake configuration files which are
taken from the X11R6 distribution.  These have only been set up for Solaris,
Linux and Digital Unix, so if you're porting it to another platform, you'll
need to do some work here.  See the Xvnc/README file for more details.

If it all builds OK you can then install the programs by running the vncinstall
script.  For example if you want to put them in /usr/local/bin, do:

	% ./vncinstall /usr/local/bin

See the file README.vncserver for information on setting up the vncserver
script.
